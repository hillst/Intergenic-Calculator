Intergenic-Calculator
=====================

Finds intergenic space and calculates FPKM and adjusted FPKM for a given annotation.

=Status=
Currently I have not been working on this tool, it will find the FPKM for each gene easily, but the intergenic calculation
was never finished (or atleast able to run on a 16GB machine).
